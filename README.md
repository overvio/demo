Agile project management for modern teams who love GitHub


## Build smarter

Overv.io is a free agile project management tool for lean teams powered by GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. Use custom issue states to track the entire life cycle of an issue as it gets picked up, delivered and accepted.

Overv.io allows you to create a project consisting of one or more GitHub repositories. The project gives you a customized kanban-like board with issues grouped in columns that represent different stages of your workflow and swimlines that represent milestones.

Overv.io gives you a bird's eye view of the project's current status. It also lets you mark issues as blocked by other issues, estimate the required effort and prioritize issues by sorting them manually with drag-and-drop. All of the changes are reflected on other developers' screens in real-time.
